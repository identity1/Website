A floral arrangement of three figural pieces. The smallest, with its back turned, is excerpted from another ceramic piece&mdash;<a href="/photos.php?title=Monitor">monitor</a>, and is designed to be moved around and placed in different locations within or outside of the larger piece (e.g., on the sill of the monitor&rsquo;s frame, facing the viewer). The two other figures or facades are part of a larger piece designed to consist of modular components including tongues of varying form and length. The tongues did not remain intact through the kiln loading/firing process. Glossy and white, the surfaces of the facades are intended to simulate the appearance of a porcelain bathroom fixture.
