<span class="title">Cavern</span>

<p>Caverns are more patient&mdash;
Than hill, or cliff, or shoreline.
They cheerily house sightless creatures,
Charging nothing for room and board.
Each is an oblong gut&mdash;
Connected to the next,
By corkscrewed passages,
Gritty and uneven,
Some half-flooded.
Here,
No intruder causes upset rumblings,
Each room,
Peacefully prepared,
In the ascetic style,
Of humble nun.
You won&rsquo;t find rubies,
Here in these depths.
Seek what you will,
And find what you must&mdash;
Caverns,
To be wholly consistent.
Droplets that fly between knobby ceiling,
And floor,
Mark the passing of seconds,
More accurately than clock.
Hop into a sinkhole,
And see for yourself.</p>
