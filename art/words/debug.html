<p>Going to sleep is like shutting your door to the world and escaping into a small room&mdash;called the self.  Here the insects of your mind are allowed to creep out and roam free, entitled to whichever specific mode of locomotion each prefers.  Some larger, glossy, armoured-type beetles may choose to beat their way steadily across the wooden floor, six legs churning their way forwards, a tiny Viking craft ebbing its way towards some distant shore.  Other sensitive, flesh-colored worms prefer to squirm daintily, twisting and corkscrewing to inaudible rhythms of thumping tribal drums, which pulsate in time to the beat of their pluralized aortic valves.  These soft-bodied squirmers appear and disappear with alarming alacrity; prone to subterranean tunneling missions, these buggers, you may find on tonight&rsquo;s a la carte menu, only to wonder where they&rsquo;ve got off to in the subsequent weeks following their sudden and unsolicited disappearance.  No use, putting out &lsquo;gone missing&rsquo; flyers or newsprint ads&mdash;the worms you are seeking will eventually return, in due time burrowing their way up between the knotted floorboards.  In the event of a cathartic downpour, however, you will observe masses of annelideal species rendered un-shy by domestic flooding&mdash;wriggling about with great energy, working together to dominate the soil-floor interface normally populated by a markedly drier and more brittle phyla.  One word of warning&mdash;these rare instances, of spontaneous, fantastic, and often orgiastic worm fiestas will be sure to bring to surface certain stringy and segmented specimen you had long forgotten about, and had intended to keep that way.  No such luck.  The luxury of picking your roommates for the night is left entirely up to nonsensical whims of a wholly soulless and unintelligent kingdom.  So go, shut that door tonight, and remember to bring your magnifying glass.</p>
