<span class="title">Dialogue</span>

<p>Choose from the candy jars.
Crystalline vessels,
Ziploc bags,
Canvas knapsacks,
Filigreed chests of gold.
Each cradles within,
A different flavor.
In one&mdash;
Roundish glossy globes,
Mild to taste,
Smooth to touch.
Another allows glimpses,
Of a pliable,
Nougaty flesh,
Stained&mdash;
The color of jaundice.
To the left, a row of fluted goblets,
Filled to the brim,
With tangerine shapes.
Soft and gummy&mdash;
These leak odorous wafts,
Of promise.
But are easily gorged upon,
They sponge up gastric juices,
Swelling,
Dominating the space.
At eye level,
Mostly teaspoon sized gems,
Unassuming,
They&rsquo;re my favorite.
Clear-ish to behold,
Dissolving daintily on the toungue,
Releasing natural extract&mdash;
Of starfruit, ginger, nectarine.
So in I reach,
Pluck an extra-tiny globule,
Off the top.
But higher up,
I notice crouching carafes,
Of brass,
Polished dispensers.
She digs hungrily from these&mdash;
Teeth,
Stained blue,
Chemical scent,
Overwhelming the lingering taste,
In my mouth.
One by one,
We pluck fruits,
From the various jars.
Popping them quickly,
Or savoring them slowly.
She reaches,
Up high,
For the black licorice.</p>
