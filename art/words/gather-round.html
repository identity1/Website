<pre>
The world seemed like a hostile place,
                                today

Was it my fault?
          Did I ever ask for the silent treatment, the cold shoulder, the hate filled eyes, the pustulent and oozing sores you so generously heaped onto my plate?

See,
Dinnertime&mdash;in this household, is a serious matter

                                 Wash your hands
                             Before sitting down,
                                 Put the napkin in your lap
                             No! Not like that&mdash;
                                 Like this
                             Hey! Don&rsquo;t touch your fork yet!
                                 We have to say grace first!
                             Everyone at the table yet?
                                 Oh&mdash;take that chair over by the corner
                             Junior can&rsquo;t sit next to Sally, remember?
                                 They&rsquo;ll fight.
                             Okay, QUIET, everyone!  Shut your eyes
                                 Bow your head
                             No peeking! Hey, quit that!!

Again, a full round of chaos ensues before the meal can even begin.
And where have we seen this before?
          You pierce me with such arctic sentiments, during the two short seconds for which we are actually making eye contact&mdash;that
          You might as well be pelting me with rock-hard vegetables in the frozen-foods section, for I am cornered in.

Broccoli, carrots, baby corn

          Bouncing off my forehead

Will they leave bruises?

          I won&rsquo;t know until tomorrow

But then what about tomorrow&rsquo;s dinner?
          We have to eat, don&rsquo;t we??
          Don&rsquo;t we?
