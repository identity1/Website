<span class="title">Great flood</span>

<p>Early afternoon&mdash;
Clear skies above tiled rooftops,
Not a cloud soliciting its presence.
Young orb of a sun,
Reflects lazily,
Off discarded soda bottle,
Casting a muted glow,
On pebbly asphalt.
Somewhere&mdash;
Loose screws titter,
Brightly painted,
Pressure builds.
They give in,
Without further protest.
Horizontal geyser splits forth&mdash;
Foamy madness
Escapes cold metal lips,
At the same time,
Vertical spout injects sky,
Pregnant,
Rain begins to fall.
A fine mist&mdash;
Inside one house&mdash;
Someone chopping onions.
Tears flow quietly,
Unnoticed.
The chopping turns to mincing.
Quick&mdash;
Down the street,
Junior yells to mom&mdash;
“Knobs&mdash;stuck!”
Edges cascade over,
With steaming bath-water,
Hurry!
Two blocks down,
Cylindrical soldiers arise,
From the lawn.
Identical,
Sweeping arcs drench
Grass and cement,
Alike.
Wetter,
And wetter&mdash;
Rain falls&mdash;
Droplets now,
Spout gushes&mdash;
Tub fills&mdash;
Inexorably,
Tears splatter&mdash;
Hit floor,
Begin to move&mdash;
Roll across textures,
Find the door,
Seep past,
To the outside
World&mdash;
Which waits.
By now,
Gutters have reached
Capacity,
Streets turn to streams&mdash;
Flowing merrily along,
Fed by clouds,
Fed by faucet,
And by pipes,
Fed by twin canals&mdash;
Of the human face&mdash;
Fed by the 
Rivers of coincidence.</p>
