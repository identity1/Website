<p>
Go on
Stick your head inside.
Swirl, undulate, elevate
The beat.
Asteroids disperse,
Starburst to the triggered
Explosion.

Explosion switches
From direct to alternating&mdash;
Implosion, explosion, implosion.
When the milky bits
Have reassembled
The new beat
Blows everything
To pieces.

Far away
On a solitary
Metal island,
We watch
With eager palms
And fixated noses
Pressed, jammed, smooshed,
Into the thick round
Of cheese-glass
That separates us
From the celestial rhythms
Resonating wild,
Outside.
