<span class="title">Silence</span>

<pre>
A tan-fleshed man pads past on soft, moist earth.
One downy tuft escapes his nest of curls,
Wafting,
Eddying,
Gently downwards.
Drapes upon snout of a chipmunk, whose breath sends it reeling.
It manages to tickle many before sparrow glides in,
Swoops to pluck tuft,
Holding wing steady--
Not a flutter.
Gripped by firm beak,
Tuft can detect no heartbeat of sparrow.
Insulation of straw-like bones, rich muscles, feather mats&mdash;
No, not mistaken,
Rightfully undetectable.
Journey to the treetop.
Breezes tug on ciliate fronds of tuft.
Tuft bends,
Then rights itself,
Same as before.
Bird-carrier wings off to the left,
Barrels diagonally,
Corkscrewing once,
Aerially,
To avoid gust.
Tuft untouched,
Spots home of sparrow.
Swiftly, sparrow alights on mossy twig,
Tuft settles calmly into twiggy nook.
Drowsy at once,
Tuft half-closes one fluttering eyelid,
Before shivering lightly.
Detecting another being,
Tuft views contents of nest,
Whose gaze lands on softly rounded object.
Tuft nods to the peachy speckled orb.
For inside,
There lies a most profound serenity&mdash;
Apart from the noises of the outside world.
