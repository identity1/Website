<span class="title">Talking Rain</span>

<p>Whispering to each other,
The dry grasses huddled close,
Casting charms,
To hurry along the rain that would soon come&mdash;
The Talking Rain.
Borne of an underground hideout,
Encrusted with crumbly fungi&mdash;
These droplets.
Stewed for centuries in the bodies of King and commoner,
Circulating, but never exiting,
This rain.
Chained to the oozing bogs of Scotland,
Insulated by moist layers,
Captured by root and leaf
Of the ageless cypress,
Talking Rain.
Rain of the sky,
And Rain of the earth&mdash;
Moisture,
That wetted Moses&rsquo; brow,
Droplet,
That clung to Bathsheba&rsquo;s breast.
This rain of yesterday,
And rain of tomorrow,
Rain of echoing well,
Rain of Babylonian dew.
This rain&mdash;
The Talking Rain.
The grasses continued to converse,
Rustling quietly,
On the dusty cliff,
Overlooking time.</p>
