An I, is an eye, is an I, is an I.  Not sure if &lsquo;I&rsquo; qualifies as a real word&mdash;it&rsquo;s just a letter that when capitalized, suddenly ceases to be one of the 26 letters of the alphabet and takes on this new meaning of a thing far deeper and more expansive than that tiny little dot-and-stroke combination could ever hope to signify. Its two forms&mdash;upper case and lower case are like husband and wife of an arranged marriage; together because someone decided to match them, together, not by choice.  The two share no common blood&mdash;it is as if they are strangers to each other.  Foreign objects alongside each other.  Ever notice how horribly awkward two &lsquo;I&rsquo;s&rsquo; look next to each other?  Yeah.  For the longest time, I&mdash;heh&mdash;tried to avoid using that letter-of-a-word anytime I had to write something personal.  Like poetry, I guess.  See, we&rsquo;re even taught in school never to use &lsquo;I&rsquo; in a real essay; but you&rsquo;re writing your own thoughts and perceptions and ideas, so that it becomes unnatural to neglect &lsquo;I&rsquo;.  You have to plan your sentences around that slew of words: I, me, you.  Not much of a slew, I guess.  You can still use him, her, he, she, it..  But there really is no substitute for that word &lsquo;I&rsquo;, at all.  And in fact, if the perfect substitute for that little word did exist&mdash;you can bet that your schoolteachers would be just as staunch in abolishing it from the confines of the classroom as they did, &lsquo;I&rsquo;.  So same, same.  Well anyways, I guess I got used to school writing assignments, because these days, I catch myself trying to omit &lsquo;I&rsquo; or reword my sentence into excluding &lsquo;I&rsquo; even within my own notes and journal entries.  Of course it&rsquo;s expected that you talk about yourself and your feelings, thoughts, emotion in something like a journal&mdash;this is just all very new to me.  Me.  Great progress is being made in the &lsquo;I&rsquo; department, and any page excerpted from my journal will be sure to contain tens of hundreds of stand-alone-&lsquo;I&rsquo;s&rsquo;.  This is good.  The poetry part still needs prompting, though.  If given a free-write, I&mdash;now speaking about my past self&mdash;would definitely choose not to write about myself.  In first person.  It would seem that I have something deeply personal against writing about myself.  But I don&rsquo;t.  It&rsquo;s just conditioning.  And I don&rsquo;t use conditioner in the shower&mdash;since years ago.  It&rsquo;s stupid, and it just weighs my hair down with residue.  And additionally lame cause that&rsquo;s just another step to take in the process of showering.  Add that to the list of daily routines and rituals&mdash;too many to count.  If it takes one minute every day, to apply and rinse out conditioner, that would amount to 365/60 = 6 hours per year.  Uh.. that&rsquo;s way less than I was expecting, but hey, 6 hours spent conditioning is 6 hours too many.  Wait, most people probably don&rsquo;t condition every day, though, so then that immediately becomes more acceptable.  But not completely.  Conditioning, though?!  What is it that is being conditioned?  Conditioning is like practice or exercise or training.  Hair can&rsquo;t be trained!  Can it?  So the letter-word &lsquo;I&rsquo;, or rather the lower case version&mdash;autocorrect keeps turning my solitary i&rsquo;s into I&rsquo;s&mdash;is an interesting pictogram that (surprise) kind of matches with its definition of the self.  Quite an unassuming pictogram, with a tiny dot as a stylized head, and the single stroke representing some semblance of a body-torso formation.  The letter &lsquo;i&rsquo; is at once, very humble.  It blends into all sorts of words we throw out of our mouths, and manages to escape undue attention&mdash;until, until it becomes CAPITALIZED.  But then capitalization further reminds me of the world, and I am uncomfortable thinking about the implications and repercussions of capitalism, and also the word, itself.  Anyhow, I think I shall delight in becoming friendly-friendly comfortable with the word &lsquo;I&rsquo; in the days to come, because obviously, usage of &lsquo;I&rsquo; does not downgrade, simplify, reduce, or take away any of the intricacy or beauty of what you are trying to convey.  Avoiding I, which sounds like improper grammar, only sidesteps the core of what you&rsquo;re trying to get at, and what I&rsquo;m trying to get at.
