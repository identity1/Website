A floral arrangement of three figural pieces. The smallest, with its back turned, is excerpted from another ceramic piece--monitor<embed hyperlink>, and is designed to be moved around and placed in different locations within or outside of the larger piece (e.g., on the sill of the monitor's frame, facing the viewer). The two other figures or facades are part of a larger piece designed to consist of modular components including tongues of varying form and length. The tongues did not remain intact through the kiln loading/firing process. Glossy and white, the surfaces of the facades are intended to simulate the appearance of a porcelain bathroom fixture.
